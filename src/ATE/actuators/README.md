## ATE/actuators

When creating an ATE tests for [sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor), we might have an idea about what Test-Cell(s) these tests will run on initially, but we don't have a crystal ball, so we don't REALLY know how on what Test-Cells the ATE
test suit will be running during it's life time.

Therefore, we make abstraction of the Test-Cell by introducing `actuators` that we want to use from the tests.

An `actuator` is something that generates a <ins>**non-electrical stimulus**</ins> to our DUT, for example:
  * [Temperature](temperature.py)
  * [Magnetic field](magnetic_field.py)
  * [Light](light.py)
  * [Acceleration](acceleration.py)
  * [Position](position.py) 
  * [Pressure](pressure.py) 
  * ...

Now, I know that it is **exctreamly tempting** to use the ATE to control the `actuator`! After all measuring a signal and
generate another one that relates to that is the bread and butter of an ATE, however in doing so you make a very costly
(boath in time and money) mistake! 

I explain with an example using two actuators : `Temperature` and `Magnetic field`:

* <ins>In our development environment</ins>, we might change the DUT's ourselves by hand, the `temperature` comes from 
a [heatgun](https://www.google.com/search?sa=X&source=univ&tbm=isch&q=heat+gun&ved=2ahUKEwj4jKDKusHpAhWEUBUIHc7iALUQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=2560&bih=1287)/[cold-spray](https://www.google.com/search?q=cold+spary&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiMyNbMusHpAhXoMewKHbEZDQ8Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=cold+spary&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIGCAAQChAYOgIIKToECAAQQzoCCABQhowCWOWfAmCUpAJoAHAAeACAAUiIAZ4FkgECMTCYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img&ei=X57EXsycIujjsAexs7R4&bih=1287&biw=2560) and the `magnetic field` from a [self-wound coil](./../../../docs/pictures/coil.jpg) with a power supply (read: a current limited voltage source) as coil-driver. 

* <ins>In production Quality Control</ins> we might have a nice magnetic field generator based on a [Helmholz coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_coil) driven by a real current source, the `temperature` might come from a 
[thermo-stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2OYzQhiLNE), and we change the DUT's by hand.

* <ins>In production Probing</ins> (aka Wafer Sort) we use a so called [prober](https://www.google.com/search?q=wafer+prober&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiOlvWcrMHpAhUKShoKHZhxBJEQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=wafer+prober&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgQIABAYMgQIABAYUOniDFik9Axg3PUMaABwAHgAgAFKiAG8BpIBAjEymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=TY_EXs67EoqUaZjjkYgJ&bih=1287&biw=2560) to change the DUT's. Most likely the prober 
can apply a `Temperature` to the DUT (hell, to the whole wafer through the [Chuck](https://www.google.com/search?source=univ&tbm=isch&q=prober+chuck&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVvNiarMHpAhVLy6QKHU71CMIQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=2560&bih=1287)) and we of course don't have a Helmholz coil to generate the `magnetic field` (because the construct of the chuck), but (yet another) coil and probably yet another real current source (adapted to the coil).

* <ins>In Final Test production</ins> we might have a commercial handler like a [Cohu/Rasco SO1000](https://www.cohu.com/so1000) to switch DUT's. This handler can apply `Temperature` himself, but an adaptation needs to be made to generate the `Magnetic field`. This will
be yet another coil (Helmhotz will not work here because of the `plungers`) and probably yet an current/voltage source.

* <ins>In Quality</ins>, they might have a [super-duper 3D magnetic field generator](./../../../docs/pictures/qc6d.png) with special designed coil drivers to generate the `magnetic field`, the `Temperature` comes from a thermo-stream, and the DUT's are changed by hand.

* <ins>In the LAB</ins>, we might want to [Shmoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmoo_plot) the tests we developed in
our `design environment` over `Temperatrue` (goes to '[reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics))', '[reproducability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility)' and '[stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_stability)' ... could extend to qualification, aka [ACQ100](http://www.aecouncil.com/AECDocuments.html), too ...) changing DUT's
will likely be by hand, `Temperature` comes from a thermo-stream (maybe even another brand/type as in orther departmenst!) and you can bet you ass on it that there will be yet another coil system to generate the `magnetic field`.

Maybe down the line for <ins>Final Test productin</ins> the Cuhu/Rasco SO1000 (this is a so called batch/singulated 
handler) needs to be replaced by an [In-Line Lead-Frame-handler](https://www.geringer.de/en/products/special-machine-building) ... do we want to touch the code that tests the DUT at such a point? No! We want to use the code developed
in the development environment and apply it to all above- and other use-cases!

If you thus use the ATE to control one or more `actuators`, it means that you pull equipment libraries in to the test
project! (think of keeping them running over the 20 years or so of the life time of a project). Also, regulating a 
`actuator` means that you maintain a kind of [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) loop ... and very 
quickly you are batteling with [threads](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science))/[processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) that in turn need to work over the lifetime of the prject which-is-way-
higher than the life time of the "controlling PC" (and then I am not thinking about the "operating system" yet ...) What is more is that a Chip Designer and a Chip Test Engineer are **NO** software engineers, **nor** automation engineers! They should **not** spend their time on `actuators`, they should spend their time on 'silicon problems'!

We can accomplish that in abstracting the Test-Cell in terms of needed `actuators`.

At **RUNTIME** these actuators are mapped to the used `Test-Cell`.

* Traditionally (read: for **non-sensor** ASIC testing) a `Test-Cell` is the mariage (monogamie if you want) of a handler/prober with an ATE. One connects the two, they fight a bit and then they start to talk to eachother.

* In **sensor** ASIC testing, we have more of a polyamorie situation ðŸ¤£ So we have more than 2 participants and then things become more difficult! A `Test-Cell` thus needs a so called `Test Cell Controller` (short TCC). This way all participants can find eachother, and the `TCC` is the one who can "map" the `actuators` to his physical 'participants'. 

In this directory, we find **ONE** file per actuator. Each file contains the [Abstract Base Class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) for the named actuator.

Any plugin to ATE.org that implements a physical actuator need to inherit from these Abastract Base Classes.
